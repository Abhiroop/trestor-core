TNETD
======
This is a fork of the trestor-core protocol originally authored by Arpan Jati, Stephan Verbucheln, Aritra Dhar and myself. I plan to fix the ongoing issues and make it entirely distributed.

Trestor Net Daemon

TNet Daemon and Simulator with UI

Currently it also has a network simulator which can simulate the consensus process and perform transactions.

These files are currently undocumented. Want to be a part of the mission? Fork the project to start contributing.
